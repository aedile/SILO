/*
 * missile.h - Atari Missile Command (1980) board emulation
 *
 * One 6502 at 1.25 MHz, a POKEY for sound, a trackball and three fire buttons.
 *
 * The unusual part is the video: there is no tilemap and no sprites. The screen is a
 * 256x231 bitmap living in the CPU's own 16 KB of RAM, two bits per pixel, and the game
 * writes to it through a side channel the schematics call MADSEL. When the CPU fetches an
 * opcode whose low five bits are 1 (the indexed-indirect addressing modes), the data access
 * five cycles later is diverted away from normal address decoding and into video RAM as a
 * two-bit pixel write. The bottom of the screen gets a third bit from a scattered set of
 * addresses, which is what gives the ground and cities their extra colours.
 *
 * Timing and memory map follow MAME's missile.cpp.
